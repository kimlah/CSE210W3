# Cards
The player starts with 300 points. A random card between 1 and 13 is displayed. The player needs to guess if the next card displayed will be higher or lower than the current card. If player guesses correctly the player will earn 100 points. If the player guesses incorrectly they will lose 75 points. If the player reaches 0 points then the game is over. If the player has more than 0 points they can choose to keep playing or end the game.
